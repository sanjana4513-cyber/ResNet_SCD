# Accuracy vs Efficiency Report

## Training Metrics Comparison

| Metric       | Value    |
|--------------|----------|
| Accuracy     | XX%      |
| Precision    | YY%      |
| Recall       | ZZ%      |
| Training Time| TT hours |

## Analysis

- **Accuracy:** The overall correctness of the model. 
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positive results in relation to all positive results. 
- **Recall:** The proportion of true positive results in relation to all actual positive samples. 
- **Training Time:** The total time taken for the training process.

## Conclusion

This report provides a basic comparison of the model's performance during training. Further analysis can be done to enhance accuracy and efficiency.
