# Project Overview
This project implements ResNet architecture with SCD (Stochastic Channel Dropout) for robust training and improved feature representation.

# Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sanjana4513-cyber/ResNet_SCD.git
   cd ResNet_SCD
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

# Usage Guide
1. To train the model, run:
   ```
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```
2. For evaluation, use:
   ```
   python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/model
   ```
3. Refer to the documentation for advanced configurations and options.
